# PdfScanner
A scanner for finding malicious Javascript embedded in Pdfs  

# Installation
Go is awesome and compiles, so you can just add the .exe to the env path and run it from the command line

# Things to note
This program is early in production, I have plans to add more features and continue adding ways to detect malicious Javascript in files
